## [CENG 783 Deep Learning](https://github.com/kadircet/CENG/tree/master/783)
Homeworks and project done during 2016-2017 Spring Semester.
No learning framework has been used in neither homeworks nor the project all
codes have been written in python from scratch using only numpy, without help
of any frameworks.
